# React Query vs Redux

## What is this ?

In this repo, I have a basic fake API, and I just wanted to demonstrate the difference between Redux and React Query.I also added the devtools for React-Query

People say that you don't even need Redux if you use React Query. Well, in my opinion, yes, React Query gets it done, but you would still need some state for, for example, isSideBarOpen. This state requires no fetching.

I would say I would prefer using React Query over Redux if all team members agree on it.
